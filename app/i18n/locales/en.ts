        question: 'What is Staking?',
        answer: 'Staking is a way to earn rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies. When you stake your digital assets, you lock them up to help maintain the security and operations of a blockchain network. In return, you earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional savings account.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How Does Staking Work?',
        answer: 'When you stake your assets, they are locked into the blockchain, which helps in maintaining network security. Based on the protocol\'s rules, you earn a reward periodically, often paid in the same cryptocurrency.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the Minimum Amount Required to Stake?',
        answer: 'The minimum amount required to stake varies depending on the blockchain network and protocol. For Solana staking through our platform, you can start with as little as 1 SOL.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I Withdraw My Staked Assets Anytime?',
        answer: 'Yes, you can withdraw your staked assets at any time. However, there might be a short unbonding period (typically a few days) before your assets become available for withdrawal.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What Are the Risks of Staking?',
        answer: 'While staking is generally considered lower risk compared to trading, there are still some risks to consider: market volatility, validator performance, technical risks, and potential slashing penalties for validator misbehavior.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How are Staking Rewards Calculated?',
        answer: 'Staking rewards are calculated based on several factors: the amount staked, staking duration, network inflation rate, and overall network participation. Our current APY is approximately 8.8%.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What Are Validator Nodes?',
        answer: 'Validator nodes are computers that participate in the blockchain network by validating and processing transactions. They play a crucial role in maintaining the network\'s security and decentralization.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is There a Fee for Staking?',
        answer: 'Yes, we charge a competitive 3% fee on staking rewards. This fee helps maintain our platform and services while ensuring you receive optimal returns on your staked assets.'
